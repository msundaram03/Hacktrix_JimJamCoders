## Problem Statement
The problem at hand involves the development of a robust regression model to accurately estimate housing costs in Chennai, India. Leveraging data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, the goal is to analyze diverse factors influencing housing prices, ranging from property size and amenities to neighborhood characteristics and market trends. By tailoring the model to the specific dynamics of Chennai's real estate market and incorporating local contextual factors, the objective is to provide stakeholders with reliable price predictions. The challenge encompasses data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and usability considerations to deliver a solution that empowers users to make informed decisions in Chennai's ever-evolving real estate landscape.

## Abstract
Estimating housing costs is important for making transactions in the real estate market. Our project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify the local real estate market . Using machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, together with data processing tools like Pandas and NumPy, a dataset containing property descriptions and characteristics is analyzed. Geospatial analysis tools are used to make use of the location based information in the dataset, which will increase the accuracy of the model. The model was created with the aim of catering to the diversity of the market in Chennai.

## Project Solution
1) Accurate Price Prediction - Linear Regression and Tree Regression Model
2) Localization and Contextualization - Dataset with over 3000 data of Chennai’s real estate dynamics were explored.
3) Feature Integration - Heatmap model to define the relation between features of the property
